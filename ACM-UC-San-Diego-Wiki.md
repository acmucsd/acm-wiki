Welcome to <b>ACM at UC San Diego's Wiki!</b>
<br><br>
This Wiki has been created to help you navigate your role as an ACM Board Member.
<br><br>
Not a Board Member? You're still free to look around, although a lot of links are restricted access.
If you're interested in becoming a Board Member, keep an eye out for position openings on social media.
We operate much like a company and so we recruit throughout the course of the year.
