# Introduction

Welcome to **ACM at UC San Diego's Wiki!**   
  
 This Wiki has been created to help you navigate your role as an ACM Board Member.   
  
 Not a Board Member? You're still free to look around, although a lot of links are restricted access. If you're interested in becoming a Board Member, keep an eye out for position openings on social media. We operate much like a company and so we recruit throughout the course of the year.
