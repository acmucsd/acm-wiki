To us, your duties as an ACM Board member are your side responsibilities.

As important as growing the ACM community is, we want every person to also remember that their own growth comes first. So we've compiled a ton of resources to help you out. All of these resources are crowdsourced so feel free to contribute in whatever means you see fit. If you'd like to start your own guide, feel free to! Just navigate to the [**Grow Folder**](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1eLo7zPMhk_lgaH4ZL-rxkWnRRR1dc63g) in the ACM Wiki.

Not a Board member? Don't worry. Each year, the Membership Team publishes a [**Membership Guide**]() which includes much of the information in the documents linked below. It'll highlight the essential pieces of information to help you navigate your career, your education, and your college experience. The Membership Team also hosts workshops on these topics in order to help you grow as ACM members!
