Need to advertise an event, project, or other activity? The Marketing Team has you covered.

## Flyers
The Marketing Team can make you flyers for your activity! We ask that the flyers come from one of the pre-made templates. This helps save the Marketing Team a ton of time and effort which can better be spent doing other marketing work. To view your options, go to the [Marketing > [1] Templates](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1EQoa52oHspI5fqTjCdS8FRnDBcybsBjC) folder. If you are hosting a large or important activity, you may ask for a custom flyers. Custom flyers should also be created in the case of event series. (Such as Hack School)

## Social Media
The Marketing Team will go ahead and advertise your events on one of three social media platforms. These include Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. For certain cases, you can reach out to the Marketing Team about creating video content for Facebook / Youtube. It is recommended that you create a special social media blurb for the Marketing Team to post.

## Photography
The Marketing Team can provide you with photographers for your event, in the case that you do not have your own camera. If you have a Google Pixel, iPhone, or phone of similar camera quality or if you have your own camera, it is suggested that you take pictures yourself if you are not too preoccupied with hosting the event (e.g. workshop hosts). These pictures should be uploaded to your events folder later where the Marketing Team will then transfer them to Flickr.
