# Finance Request

Looking for money for something? Well, it depends on what you're looking for.

## Food

If your event needs food, this is covered through funding from Associated Students. The whole process is a logistical nightmare and so to prevent you from going through it, we've made the following form to streamline the process. The Vice President Internal is responsible for obtaining the funding, but is unable to approve it. That is dependent on Associated Students, a third party. If funding is unable to be obtained, see [\# All Else.](https://github.com/acmucsd/wiki/wiki/Finance-Request#all-else)

To request event funding for food, fill out the [Logistics Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdq5C1uuL2hxzHzKCKW-gEPmHRoHoxA9jgt0ml2XISIKxg2RA/viewform?usp=sf_link). For more information, [read the Logistics Request wiki page.](https://github.com/acmucsd/wiki/wiki/Logistics-Request).

## Travel

The Executive Board will announce which conferences are being funded. If you wish to travel to any other conference or for any other purpose, we recommend filling out the Jacobs Travel Fund. This money comes from the IDEA Center, a third party.

To request funding for travel, fill out the IDEA Center Travel Fund form. Note that this form is not connected to ACM.

## All Else

If the above two do not meet what you're looking for, or your activity no longer is able to request funding, then you can seek funding from ACM's other means. That is, we are funded by the Triton Software Engineering Student Council and by corporate sponsors. The Vice President Finance is in charge of approving this funding.
