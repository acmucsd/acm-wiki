ACM's calendar is used to schedule and announce ACM's numerous events. A more detailed guide on how to use each Calendar can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T7U486sfgatjTu3dCJrNJ_93Piyd_w9x3lJAVk13TRU/edit)

## Internal Calendar
The Internal Calendar is labeled as "ACM Board". If you need access to this calendar, please contact an Executive Board Member. This calendar contains events private to the ACM Board. This includes Board meetings, events, and other activities.

Note that you can, and should be, labeling each calendar event with tags between square brackets. <br>
We utilize IFTTT in order to sync our calendar with other platforms such as Discord.<br>
A list of tags can be found in the guide.

## External Calendar
The External Calendar is labeled as "ACM". The reason why it's called "ACM" and not "ACM External" is because this is the primary calendar that is visible to all ACM Members. Every event on here should be public information. Please include both a **title** and **description** for each event. Failure to do so shall provoke the wrath of the Vice President Internal.
