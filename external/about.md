# Office of the Vice President External

## Scope

The job of External is to create and manage ACM's brand and relationships.

#### Brand

ACM is the world's largest computing society. As a student chapter of this, we need to effectively promote and leverage the larger ACM brand while still emphasizing the independence and unique value of our chapter. When making decisions regarding our brand, it's important to think about who we're designing for. Brand primarily affects outside groups, whether those groups are students that aren't in ACM, potential sponsors, or university contacts. Brand also affects ACM internally, and a good brand leads to pride in ACM.

_What Makes a Good Brand_

A good brand isn't something that can be done just by a nice logo and clean website \(that helps however\). Brand is something that is earned overtime by **listening** and creating **with** our audience. To create and maintain a good brand isn't a formulaic process, but rather an adapting and highly feedback-oriented approach.



_Specifically within ACM, what does External Manage?_

External manages all communication for ACM UC San Diego. This includes inter-club, inter-chapter, and company relations. External also manages all student communications, including marketing and social media.
