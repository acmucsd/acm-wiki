# Marketing - PR

## What is Marketing - PR?

Marketing makes sure ACM's brand is known, and makes sure that our external representations are accurate to our culture and ideals.

### Weekly Drive

Each Week, you should submit the PR required for events happening for the events happening 2 weeks from the current date.

Ie: if 1/1 is a Monday, you should have all events for the 1/15 Week \(yes, week\) queued up and ready to be advertised

### Asset Types

* **Cover Photo Graphic**

### What to do for each event

1. Facebook Event — Schedule for release **1 Week before official date**
   1. staggering them to be 1 week before official date \(despite the fact that newsletter comes out later\) allows each event to independently gain some traction
   2. Use **Cover Photo Graphic**
2. Instagram Post — Schedule for release **1 Day before official date**
   1. One day before allows instagram users to see it and keep it in their mind
   2. Use **Instagram Photo Graphic**
3. Membership Portal
