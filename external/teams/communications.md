# Communications

## Role

The Communications Team deals with contacting all other entities outside of ACM UC San Diego. This includes being our primary point of contact with our sponsors, our student organization partners, and the international ACM community.

## Responsibilities

* \*Communications Director \(PR Side\)
  * Tasked with Weekly Newsletter to be put out every Sunday around 7:30pm. 

    * Open up Mailchimp, and log in : 
      * Username: acmucsd
      * Password: v\#CV8!R4usKv853MvI2m 
    * Go to any newsletter from that current quarter, and "replicate" it by clicking the pull down menu on the right hand side of that newsletter.
    * Go to the fields and edit accordingly. Generally the letter will be sent as "Week \_\_ Newsletter" 
    * Write interesting, funny, witty opener etc. to lead into the events. Can honestly be done in any way or style but this is current template.
    * Update text and titles and links accordingly
    * At the bottom, include member spotlight. Usually an image with questions and answers below. Personalize as you see fit. 
    * Image uploads are in a weird place for Mailchimp. Go to the upper right corner and click "upload" and then select your picture to upload. Then you can use it in the newsletter. 
    * At the top, make sure to feature the "This Week in ACM" updated graphic. As it stands when you upload the image Mailchimp freaks out and is like, "This is too big!" So just click "let's fix this" under edit and scale it a little bit down. Easy fix, or tell design team to make a smaller one. Either way works.  

  * Tasked with Weekly Membership Spotlight 

    * Go to events or network, and find a member you find interesting or would like to get to know better. 
    * Come up with questions beforehand of course, and then go meet them \(preferable\) or send the questions to them to fill out
    * Post to bottom of newsletter every week, make a medium post about them \(follow pre-existing template if confused\), and make a post about in in FB and Discord linking to the member spotlight.

  * Tasked with Weekly FB and Discord Posts
    * Facebook
      * Scroll down ACM UCSD's facebook page. Press ctrl-f and search for "week". Find any existing post that is about the week's events.
      * Copy paste that to a new post, and edit/update the information to current week's information.
      * Again, can be changed/revised. Up to poster's discretion.
      * Make another FB post, linking to member spotlight
    * Discord
      * Copy paste FB's post, go to "important" section and post it. Make sure to @everyone
      * Also do another post @everyone linking to the member spotlight
  * Tasked with Making the Weekly Graphic
    * Go to ACM UCSD's figma page. Here's a link to our drafts and finalized graphics :[https://www.figma.com/file/T3SzPMtLr7M1XJkZz0YQCC/Marketing-Design-System?node-id=593%3A2](https://www.figma.com/file/T3SzPMtLr7M1XJkZz0YQCC/Marketing-Design-System?node-id=593%3A2)
    * Look for a "This Week in ACM" graphic in drafts. Zoom in, and double click the text boxes until you can type in them. Update the information there. If it can't fit then just shorthand the events. Try to feature one social event, one workshop, and the third event can be whatever. If there's two events on the same day and you're only able to post a few events, try including the start time of the event in the text box so it doesn't look as weird. 
    * Change the emojis if possible. It is okay if they don't match up to the event type but at least try. I believe you can search the other graphics and find the ones you want from there and just copy and paste to your new one. Or just git gud and learn figma lol \(I suck at figma\). 
    * Double click the graphic, go to the bottom right corner of your screen and hit "export" under the share tab. 
    * Upload this to FB profile picture and the Weekly Newsletter.   
  * Make the New acmurl.com/week\(\#\) link
    * Go to acmurl.com/forms
    * Redirect the page to acm's fb page
    * for the shorturl thing just type "week7" or whatever week it actually is
  * Quarterly Report
    * Speak to VP External about this and the president. Generally, you should have a good idea of what the club has been up to but since you aren't required to attend events it can be hard to keep up. They will fill you in on what to do for this but basically you are just giving a good report of our organization. Templates should be up on our google drive somewhere, type in "Quarterly Report" or something similar. Use that format or make your own. Discuss events, membership, future goals, achievements, etc. 
  * Medium Article Editor
    * People can send you medium articles and you are in charge of vetting and publishing.
