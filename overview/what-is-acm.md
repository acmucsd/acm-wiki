## Globally

The Association for Computing Machinery, also known as ACM, is the world’s largest society for computing. Created during the beginning of the Computer Revolution, the organization has played a strong role in the development of the field. With over 100,000 members, ACM’s members span the entire globe and are leaders throughout industry and research. The organization aims to advance the field of computing as both a science and as a profession, so that its members can use their knowledge for the greater social good.

## UC San Diego

At UC San Diego, an ACM Student Chapter has been started in 2019 in order to foster a diverse community devoted to the field of computing. This is a community not limited to only computer scientists, but also open to computer engineers, software engineers, app developers, data scientists, bioinformatics specialists, designers and all else who are also interested in computing. This organization exists to enhance students' personal and professional networks, further their technical skills, introduce them to new and exciting opportunities, help them to pursue new ideas, and connect them with ACM members both at UC San Diego and around the world.
