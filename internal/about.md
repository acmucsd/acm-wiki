# Office of the Vice President Internal

## About

Welcome to logistics hell! Just kidding, but I hope you're responsible because as you can see below, there is a lot to keep track of in this role.

The Vice President Internal heads the Internal team, which is responsible for hosting events such as workshops, professional development events, and socials. Their responsiblities include, but are not limited to, assisting Event Directors in brainstorming ideas, gathering resources, and hosting activities/events.

## Duties

The VPI's roles are as follows:

* Oversee ACM internal events
  * Host bi-weekly team meetings with Event Directors
    * Go over each personâ€™s upcoming events for the next ten school weeks and check status on them
    * Give advice, make sure the Event Director has planned everything out \(content, marketing, room choices, slides\)
    * Look out for overwork
  * Manage the logistics behind hosting events on and off campus
    * Fill out funding
    * Book rooms for events
    * Fill out TAP forms
    * Have Event Directors give a preferred time/room a quarter in advance
* Handle Executive Board tasks
  * General org management and attendance/contribution at weekly org meetings
  * Make executive decisions
  * Register to be a student organization at the end of summer
  * Book ACM a table on library walk during tabling season

## Onboarding

As VPI, you gotta know your stuff. By the end of the year you will know the resources listed at the bottom of this wiki page by heart, so to start out make sure you read the _Funding Guide_ \(as this is due first in an event's lifespan\), familiarize yourself with the different rooms to book and how to book them, and start using Monday.com ASAP -- there's a lot to do for each event! Task management is no joke!

## VPI Timeline and Resources

### Timeline

* **8 weeks prior** - All event info from event directors should be submitted on the Event Request Form.
  * Make this clear when new Technical Directors or Social Directors are onboarded!
  * Look into availability for rooms \(some get booked very far in advance or we have limited access to them\)
  * This gives you 2 weeks to submit the funding request.
* **6 weeks prior** - Funding request due
  * This includes: food, drinks, supplies, flyers, room booking
* **5 weeks prior** - Funding confirmation received
* **4 weeks prior** - START TAP FORM
* **3 weeks prior** - Appeal for funding due IF it was denied
  * Have ROOM BOOKED with confirmation number/ID

### Resources

* [Student Org Registration](https://studentorgregistration.ucsd.edu/)
* [Event Request Form](https://forms.monday.com/forms/d34defbd43143905715dc14caa5cdcb3)
  * Have any board member who wants to host an event fill out this form with all of the details about the event. The intent is that the information they provide on this form will make filling out the Funding request and the TAP form as easy as possible.
* [AS Funding](https://finance.ucsd.edu/)
  * The event director probably wants something funded, whether it's food, flyers, or utensils -- make sure you give yourself plenty of time to fill this out because it's a lengthy boi.
  * [Funding Guide](https://finance.ucsd.edu/home/fundingguide) - READ THIS. I'd say roughly the first 1/2 - 2/3 is relevant to our org events, but it's really important that you know all of this info without me summarizing it for you and possibly missing important details.
* [Room Bookings](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MEDvrSyJN-fZWl-iEyXfNpcVDG5kTS2Wx3O5-DO8fLA/edit#gid=0)

    * Located right off the lobby of Jacobs Hall in Warren, this is a great location to reach engineering students and has plenty of space.
